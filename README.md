## Project Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the process of performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The scripts and notebooks in this repository cover a range of datasets and showcase different techniques and visualizations used in EDA.

The goal of EDA is to understand the data, discover patterns, identify anomalies, and derive meaningful insights that can inform decision-making or guide further analysis.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python and the required libraries installed.
The following libraries are used in this project:
Pandas : [https://pandas.pydata.org/]
NumPy : [https://numpy.org/install/]
Matplotlib : [https://matplotlib.org/]
Seaborn : [https://seaborn.pydata.org/]
If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official Python website: [(https://www.python.org/downloads/)]
Or you can use Anaconda (Jupyter Notebook) : [https://www.anaconda.com/]

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   git clone https://github.com/shubhamkulal/Python-exploratory-data-analysis.git

2. Navigate to the specific dataset or analysis of interest.
3. Open the Python script or Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or any Python IDE).
4. Execute the code cells or run the script to perform the EDA.
5. Explore the visualizations, summary statistics, and insights obtained from the analysis.
